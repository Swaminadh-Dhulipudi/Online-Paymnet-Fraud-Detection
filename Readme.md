**# Online-Paymnet-Fraud-Detection**

**Overview** : This project aims to detect and prevent online payment fraud using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, the system identifies potentially fraudulent activities, providing a layer of security for online transactions.

**Features** : Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for model training. Machine Learning Models: Implement and compare various models for fraud detection. Real-time Monitoring: Develop a system for real-time monitoring of transactions. Alerts: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, notifying stakeholders.

**Technologies Used** : Python Scikit-learn Matplotlib

**Getting Started **: Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/Swaminadh-Dhulipudi/Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection.

**Install dependencies**: pip install -file requirements.txt

**Dataset Link** : Utilize a labeled dataset containing examples of both normal and fraudulent transactions.
